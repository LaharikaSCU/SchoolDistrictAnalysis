# Challenge
The school board has identified academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

When assessing school summaries and performing schools, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools.

After replacing both math and reading scores, Thomas High School was taken out of the top five category since they now display a 65% overall passing.

When reviewing the School Size summary, removing the ninth grade scores did not affect the average math and reading scores, but it did affect the passing percentages for medium-sized schools (1000-2000). In this category, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing dropped 6% each. Before the data change, the School Size summary showed that medium-sized school had a high performance (91% overall passing) compared to small (90% overall passing) and large schools (58% overall passing). Given the data change, medium size school are the second in performance (85% overall passing).


### School Type Summary

In reviewing the last summary on School Types, this data change also affected the passing percentages that compared charter and district schools. Fortunately, it did not affect the average scores for these two school types. Removing the scores resulted in a reduction in charter school's passing percentages. Before the data change, charter schools had very high passing percentages: 94% passing math, 97% passing reading, 90% overall passing. After the data change, charter schools now have a 90% passing math, 93% passing reading, 87% overall passing. On the plus side, these rates are still far superior when compared to district schools.
